# Garden Chain PL/SQL Project

## Purpose
Developed as part of a University module to deliver a scalable, normalised database solution for a scenario-based national garden centre chain. This project showcases the practical application of PL/SQL in data modelling, entity-relationship (ER) design, transactional processing, and report generation.

## Functionality
- Schema designed in Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and scalability.
- A single reproducible PL/SQL script initialises the database following a structured sequence: dropping, creating, populating, testing, and committing.
- Implementation of data constraints, triggers, and stored procedures to maintain data consistency and automate logic.

## Testing
- All PL/SQL procedures and functions are thoroughly tested for expected outputs and logical accuracy.
- Custom error handling implemented with exception blocks, managing invalid operations and reinforcing data integrity.

## Tools and Environment
- Oracle SQL Developer + Visual Studio Code (Oracle Extension) 
- Oracle Cloud Database (Transactional Processing)
- PL/SQL
